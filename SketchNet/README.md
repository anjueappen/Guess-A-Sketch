# How to run the API

First, put the training images in a directory named `png` at this repo's root directory.

Then, install python2.7. On a Mac, you might need to do `brew install python` then `brew link python`.

Install dependencies
```sh
pip2 install -r SketchNet/api/requirements.txt
```

Run the API
```sh
python2 SketchNet/api/api.py
```

# How to Setup Your GPU instance for Training 

1. Create a Cybera RAC Account [here](https://rac-portal.cybera.ca)
2. Create a GPU instance following the instructions listed [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12_iH7oFfP2MTBi7wCR92PiIalhsB8i2bcz2G89wUsmk/edit#heading=h.uvc95u5xadk8)
3. ssh into your instance with 

        ssh -i cloud.key ubuntu@<floating IP>
        
4. Run the setup script

        wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anjueappen/Guess-A-Sketch/master/SketchNet/envs/setup.sh
        bash setup.sh 
       
5. The script completes by rebooting up your instance. After a minute, ssh back onto your instance and you should be able to train models via GPU


##### Here are some outputs you should see - note how the CUDA libraries are opened when you import Tensorflow.
