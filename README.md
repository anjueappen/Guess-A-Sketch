Guess-a-Sketch
===

Half party game, half science project.

Each round, you get a prompt (eg "Cat"). Draw it! 
Well, as best you can, until the timer runs out. 
Get points based on the speed and quality of your drawing.

Points are awarded by an AI that has learned to recognize objects
in napkin-quality sketches. The AI learns using a variety of neural networks - that's the
science project part.
